# Overview

The Consulting Partner ecosystem is vital to the success of Amazon Connect. Our customers rely on you to deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions that enable them to help their customers in the best way possible.

Amazon Connect offers customers an innovative option to traditional contact center technologies. Amazon Connect began as an internally-developed solution to support the Customer Service team at Amazon.com. With over 70,000 agents and a global presence, Amazon needed a solution that could scale, easily extend to internal services, and provide outstanding call quality. Because that didn't exist, Amazon built it.

Three years ago, Amazon Connect launched as a Contact Center as a Service offering. As an AWS service, Amazon Connect enables customers to work backwards from their desired experiences, using all of the AWS services as building blocks. Embedding serverless computing from within a contact flow using Amazon Lambda, users can easily integrate with source data and enable extended functionality with external solutions.
