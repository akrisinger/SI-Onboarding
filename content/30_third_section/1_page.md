## Use Case

Amazon Connect enables a chat channel that uses the same contact flows as the voice channel. In a truly omni-channel design, the only distinction between a chat interaction and a voice interaction is the field "channel" in the data.

To deploy Chat for your customers, you not only need to enable it in the routing profiles and in the contact flows, you also need to enable the ingress of the chat conversation, which is usually your customer's webpage.

This training module uses a CloudFormation template to facilitate the chat widget.
