## Use Case
Contact Center data is a critical requirement for our customers. In legacy solutions, customers were constrained to whatever reporting platform came with the ACD. Amazon Connect shifts that paradigm. The data that is generated from Amazon Connect belongs to the customer to do whatever they want with.

Amazon Connect delivers data in a myriad of ways. Customers can access both historical and realtime data through the Connect UI. That data can be exported, scheduled, etc. Data can also be streamed and delivered to any destination that the customer desires, such as a data visualization tool or a data lake.

## Streaming Data Model

Source => Stream Ingestion => Storage => Stream Processing => Destination
