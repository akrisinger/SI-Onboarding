# Welcome!

Thank you for your desire to learn more about Amazon Connect. The Amazon Connect Consulting Partner ecosystem is vital to the success of our service. We are excited to help you onboard with these advanced modules that are based off of our in-person bootcamps.

One of the most important things to remember as you begin this journey is that Amazon Connect, like all AWS services, encourages our customers to become builders. When our Consulting Partners are engaged to deliver an Amazon Connect Contact Center, the responsibility to build falls on you! Amazon Connect functionality is only constrained by your ability to architect and deliver solutions using integrated AWS Services as well as Amazon Connect Technology integrations.

To that end, we encourage you to get your hands dirty. The best learning happens when we are faced with a problem and the tools to solve the problem on our own. With Amazon Connect, we don't limit ourselves to what's in the box; instead we explore the art of the possible.

Again, thank you for your willingness to learn. The Amazon Connect Partner SA team is here to facilitate your onboarding and we look forward to working with you on many future engagements!
