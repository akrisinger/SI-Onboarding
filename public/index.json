In a truly omni-channel design, the only distinction between a chat interaction and a voice interaction is the field \u0026ldquo;channel\u0026rdquo; in the data.\nTo deploy Chat for your customers, you not only need to enable it in the routing profiles and in the contact flows, you also need to enable the ingress of the chat conversation, which is usually your customer\u0026rsquo;s webpage.\nThis training module uses a CloudFormation template to facilitate the chat widget.\nChat Code (GitHub) Amazon Connect Chat UI Examples Amazon Connect Chat Javascript Library\nIntegrated Services  Amazon Connect CloudFormation DynamoDB Lambda CloudWatch  Training Deploying Amazon Connect Chat\n"

Amazon Connect shifts that paradigm. The data that is generated from Amazon Connect belongs to the customer to do whatever they want with.\nAmazon Connect delivers data in a myriad of ways. Customers can access both historical and realtime data through the Connect UI. That data can be exported, scheduled, etc. Data can also be streamed and delivered to any destination that the customer desires, such as a data visualization tool or a data lake.\nStreaming Data Model Source =\u0026gt; Stream Ingestion =\u0026gt; Storage =\u0026gt; Stream Processing =\u0026gt; Destination\nIntegrated Services  Amazon Connect CloudFormation DynamoDB Lambda CloudWatch  Training Advanced Reporting\n"
