Amazon Connect shifts that paradigm. The data that is generated from Amazon Connect belongs to the customer to do whatever they want with.\nAmazon Connect delivers data in a myriad of ways. Customers can access both historical and realtime data through the Connect UI. That data can be exported, scheduled, etc. Data can also be streamed and delivered to any destination that the customer desires, such as a data visualization tool or a data lake.\nStreaming Data Model Source =\u0026gt; Stream Ingestion =\u0026gt; Storage =\u0026gt; Stream Processing =\u0026gt; Destination\nIntegrated Services  Amazon Connect CloudFormation DynamoDB Lambda CloudWatch  Training Online Training: Advanced Reporting\nPDF of Online Course: Advanced Reporting PDF\n"

We are excited to help you onboard with these advanced modules that are based off of our in-person bootcamps.\nOne of the most important things to remember as you begin this journey is that Amazon Connect, like all AWS services, encourages our customers to become builders. When our Consulting Partners are engaged to deliver an Amazon Connect Contact Center, the responsibility to build falls on you! Amazon Connect functionality is only constrained by your ability to architect and deliver solutions using integrated AWS Services as well as Amazon Connect Technology integrations.\nTo that end, we encourage you to get your hands dirty. The best learning happens when we are faced with a problem and the tools to solve the problem on our own. With Amazon Connect, we don\u0026rsquo;t limit ourselves to what\u0026rsquo;s in the box; instead we explore the art of the possible.\nAgain, thank you for your willingness to learn. The Amazon Connect Partner SA team is here to facilitate your onboarding and we look forward to working with you on many future engagements!\nContributing Authors: Vish Kale, Sr. Partner SA, Contact Center (NA)\nRamprasad Srirama, Sr. Partner SA, Contact Center (NA)\nAngela Krisinger, Sr. Partner SA, Contact Center (NA)\nNawaz Varda, Specialist PSA, Connect (EMEA)\nMiguel Martinez Rogers, Specialist PSA Connect (EMEA)\nWill Scott, Specialist CSM, Comm Apps (EMEA)\nJuan Antonio Estival Varela, Specialist SA Connect (EMEA)\n"

	"content": "Overview The Consulting Partner ecosystem is vital to the success of Amazon Connect. Our customers rely on you to deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions that enable them to help their customers in the best way possible.\nAmazon Connect offers customers an innovative option to traditional contact center technologies. Amazon Connect began as an internally-developed solution to support the Customer Service team at Amazon.com. With over 70,000 agents and a global presence, Amazon needed a solution that could scale, easily extend to internal services, and provide outstanding call quality. Because that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, Amazon built it.\nThree years ago, Amazon Connect launched as a Contact Center as a Service offering. As an AWS service, Amazon Connect enables customers to work backwards from their desired experiences, using all of the AWS services as building blocks. Embedding serverless computing from within a contact flow using Amazon Lambda, users can easily integrate with source data and enable extended functionality with external solutions.\nBefore embarking on the advanced modules in this online workshop, please ensure that you have completed the Primer on the AWS Partner Network.\n A Primer on Amazon Connect   Additional Resources for Integrated Services   "
